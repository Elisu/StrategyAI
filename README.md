TLDR:
Artificial intelligence presents a highly researched field with significant
contribution to the progress of modern technologies. As there exist numerous
distinct approaches to AI implementation, games can be conveniently utilized
as environments for their testing. This thesis aims to create a simple strategy

its usage, several of those approaches, mostly evolutionary, are realized together
with assessment of their performance.
